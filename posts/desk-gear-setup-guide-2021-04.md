subtitle: Here are some ways to level up your home office setup.
summary: >-
  I've compiled together a list of all the high quality desk/work from home gear
  I've used or know of in one place (so you don't have to waste money on things
  that are not great!) This is the list I wish I had when I started building my
  setup!


  These will skew towards the higher price range in these categories, but I'll try to include any budget options I know that are solid, or I've personally tested. Generally, I'm looking at a balance of quality, aesthetic and price range. I'll call out anything in this list that I haven't personally owned or used.
